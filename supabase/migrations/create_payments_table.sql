/*
  # Create payments table

  1. New Tables
    - `payments`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `trainer_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
      - `client_id` (uuid, foreign key to clients)
      - `amount` (numeric)
      - `payment_date` (timestamptz)
      - `method` (text) -- e.g., 'Pix', 'Cart√£o', 'Dinheiro'
      - `notes` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now())
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz, default now())
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `payments` table
    - Add policy for authenticated users (trainers) to read their own payments
    - Add policy for authenticated users (trainers) to create payments
    - Add policy for authenticated users (trainers) to update their own payments
    - Add policy for authenticated users (trainers) to delete their own payments
